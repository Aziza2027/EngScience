Rules in writing articles:

Be conscience, do not put the main point to the end.
that annoys the reader a little bit and this annoyance 
can be accumulated and the reader is gonna throw that
into trash. 
Don't delay the subject and make it simple. Because 
every sentence of yours is a stress for the reader. 

Do not use passive voice. Be active, take 
responsibility for your work. 

Be conscience, clear, and short.

Now what I am more interested in the review articles

Methods:

When you're writing methods part it's important
to choose the correct tense because it might confuse
the reader. Do not rush, use as simple tenses as 
possible.
It should be simple and crystal clear so that the 
reader should be able to replicate the methodology.


Results:

If you did something, tell YOU DID IT, take responsibility  
for it. DO NOT USE PASSIVE. 

The present tense: what OTHERS have found
The past tense: what YOU have found

Do not put long describtion for tables. Just interpret it.
